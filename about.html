                    <h3>Worker and Educational Background</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Noah, my online alias is `Ender`, I am an active learning game developer, ethical hacker in learning, and a hardworking reliable worker.<br>
                    Consisting my background: I have been making games through the Unity Engine since September 2019, junior year of high school.<br>
                    I graduated high school with a 4.0+ GPA, participating in Honors & CCP Mathemathics as well as I graduated from Stark State College with a 3.9+ GPA,<br>
                    I currently have an Associates Degree for Video Game Design & Development.<br><br>
                    I have experience programming in several languages such as Java, Python, C#.<br>
                    I am a fast learner and comfortable working with groups to complete tasks before deadlines.
                </p>

                    <h3>My Game Development Adventure</h3>
                <p>
                    My early inspiration towards general programming started during early middle school, we would program VEX Robotics toys for small projects.<br>
                    I became hooked to the idea of writing code to these small vehicals and I was the best in my class when it came to it, often helping other students debug their code.<br>
                    During my two years at Stark State College I often assisted the other students in my classes when it came to debugging code,<br>
                    I often would let the other classmates know if they are struggling with their code<br>
                    That they are free to contact me or come over and ask me any questions they have so I can help set them in the<br>
                    right direction and help them experience the learning curve I did, because when you can figure out the<br>
                    difficult problems and continue moving forward, I believe that is the greatest feeling that motivates any person to strive forward through the fog.<br><br>
                    I first started learning how to program through <a href="https://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> I started with HTML, CSS, & JS. Eventually I started trying other languages like Python and Java.<br>
                    I didn't have much to display when first learning until I tried out the 2019 Unity Game Engine. I started learning rapidly how to build small video games.<br>
                    I would often give myself a random theme and challenge myself to build a working project in one week. I enjoyed both the challenge and the learning curve as I began learning to build common game mechanics and understanding parts of Unitys C# Framework.<br>
                    I eventually created an <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/">Itch.IO</a> account so I could participate in Game-Jams, between 2021 and 2023 I've completed 10 jams and published around 15+ games.<br>
                    Currently my project <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> is my magnum opus. In one year <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> rose 200+ views, while the average view count for my other titles is around 20.<br>
                    I've mostly gone through my game development adventure on my own, teaching myself how to program in Unity, work 3D modeling softwares like Blender, I have completed Jams with partners, I don't get to often but I believe I can be a valuable asset<br>
                    for staying on task and ensuring the workspace is manageable and clean, allowing any new partners to enter and immediently feel comfortable and begin working.
                </p>

                    <h3>Path of Ethical Hacking</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been self-teaching myself <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/activity/625394" target="_blank">ethical hacking</a> using Kali Linux and pwning machines on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a> since March 2022,<br>
                    most of my experience revolves around Linux-based machine, but I am open to learn more about pwning Windows Environments!<br>
                    My batch of experience working with Python has came from reading and writing my own code for exploits when attacking machines.<br>
                    I do have experience writing my own small scripts in Bash Script.
